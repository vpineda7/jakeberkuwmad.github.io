    <p>I currently work as a Digital User Experience designer at Springs Window Fashions working with industry-leading brands like <a href="/portfolio/bali-redesign">Bali Blinds</a> and <a href="/portfolio/graber-visualization">Graber Blinds</a>. In 2015, I graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and a degree in computer science. At the University of Wisconsin, I discovered a passion for telling compelling stories with innovative, insightful design. I have carried this with me in every opportunity since. I have worked with a wide range of companies, from nonprofits and educational institutions, to small tech startups and industry-leading corporations.</p>
    <p id="second-paragraph">I am currently busy volunteering with <a href="https://wisconsin.aiga.org/" target="_blank">AIGA Wisconsin</a> on projects like <a href="http://designlikemadison.com" target="_blank">Design Like Mad</a>. The goal of Design Like Mad is to connect nonprofit organizations with designers, developers, and other creative professionals to develop essential marketing and communications materials at no cost to the nonprofit. Since 2013, Design Like Mad has supported 73 local nonprofits and engaged over 200 designers and developers. In 2017, I assembled and managed team of 9 volunteers to organize largest Design Like Mad event to date.</p>
