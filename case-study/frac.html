title: Drawing Lines in the Frac Sand
description: Frac sand mining is a complex issue debated around the worldâ€”nowhere more than in Wisconsin, home to large reserves of this unique sand. The Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism has followed the rise of this industry in Wisconsin for the past five years. The Center's exhaustive, long-form reports cover the politics, health effects and environmental impact. Unfortunately, without a proper understanding of the mining process and industry, these reports lose significance.

    <p>The Center approached me, interested in distilling this information into a more accessible format. Their original idea was to create a small information graphic with small, quippy illustrations. I challenged them to rethink their usual approach (long-form reports and information graphics.) My idea: let sand tell its own story. Use actual sand to illustrate a handful of points, and make it easy to share.</p>

    <p>Once we had our idea, a script and an initial series of rough illustrations, I started production. For one long night, hunched over a well-lit workspace with nothing but a camera and sand, I completed all the animations. For touch-ups and building sequences, I used Photoshop, and created the video with Final Cut Pro. More details on the production are shared in <a href="http://wisconsinwatch.org/2015/04/podcast-how-we-animated-wisconsins-frac-sand-rush/" target="_blank">this podcast</a>.</p>

    <p>The response to the project has been strong. Mining industry representatives and environmental activists were surprised by the project. Feedback from both groups is included in <a href="http://wisconsinwatch.org/2015/04/12-sandy-gifs-an-animated-guide-to-wisconsins-frac-sand-rush/" target="_blank">this article</a>. At the annual Milwaukee Press Club awards, the Center took home a <a href="http://www.milwaukeepressclub.org/2015-excellence-in-journalism-awardees/" target="_blank">Gold in "Best Use of Multimedia"</a> for this project.</p>
