title: Incident Reporting App
description: University Housing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison provides a home for over 7,400 undergraduate students. Each year, University Housing hires over 100 students as House Fellows. House Fellows support and foster an active academic community and uphold Housing policy. When policy is violated, House Fellows write incident reports. University Housing expressed interest in fully digitizing submission of Incident Reports (colloquially known as “documenting” an incident). The goal was alleviating the demand the current process places on House Fellows and ensuring more accurate reports, a benefit to residents.

    <p>Two cultural probes helped better understand the processes of responding to and documenting incidents. The first, a usability survey, focused on difficulty and time spent. This easily completed form was filled out any time an incident occurred. The survey aimed to capture the time spent on each section of information within the Incident Report web application. It also asked for a rating on the level of difficulty of completing each section. The second probe was an in-depth diary study completed by a select group of House Fellows. These House Fellows worked a variety of Residence Halls, each with unique and diverse communities. The short survey helped identify common breakdowns in the process for all House Fellows. The comprehensive diary study highlighted how a House Fellow's routine and lifestyle influenced their work. Many additional contextual inquiries and interviews performed on site highlighted breakdowns in this process.</p>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>After evaluating the data from the cultural probes, two design ideas emerged as possible solutions. The first leverages a system of templates to step through all possible incidents. This alleviates inaccuracies and headaches caused by missing information. It also allows University Housing more control over the process. For example, if they wanted to know the amount of beer in a resident's room, they could update the template to ensure the House Fellow records that information. The second design idea divorces itself from any strict process and instead is informed by House Fellow behavior. When responding to an incident, House Fellows can do two things: take notes and record residents' information. Cultural probe participants made clear that good collaboration was key to successful documentation. This solution makes that easy by allowing the House Fellows to pair their devices.</p>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>Further evaluation of the two design ideas took place in two parts. First, a keystroke-level model (KLM) for each idea predicted the time it would take to complete a common task. The template-driven design saved time by reducing the effort spent thinking or making decisions. The collaborative design was more efficient, though. All the required data could be recorded without navigating deep into the app. The second part of the evaluation involved user tests. House Fellows tested a clickable prototype, created with Invision, in mock scenarios. Inexperienced House Fellows responded positively to the template-driven design. It ensured they captured all the information they needed. Experienced House Fellows felt it didn't account for the unpredictable nature of responding to an incident. All participants responded positively to the collaboration functionality and Wiscard ID scanner.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>After a better performance in the KLM and user testing, the collaboration-driven design was adopted as the final solution. Templates are still available, but only when writing notes. Instead of requiring answers, the app lists a few unique questions and tips. The only identification needed for a resident is their unique Wiscard ID. It can be manually entered or scanned using the phone's camera. This saves time and ensures accuracy. The app also automatically logs the time of an incident and where it occurred. Finally, a list of emergency and important contacts is always only a click away. Several of these wireframed solutions are shown below.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>The three main actions when documenting an incident are note taking, identifying residents and filing a report. User testing proved that the final solution makes each of these three tasks quicker, easier and more accurate. Focusing attention on cultural probes allowed House Fellows to directly inspire our design process. Supplemental contextual inquiries ensured scientifically valid information that supported all the decisions.</p>
