title: Timesheets Redesign
description: At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Student Center is a widely used application. It is used to register for classes, fill out time sheets, and more. Despite it's essential utilities, the application's interface is notoriously egregious and fundamentally unusable. The challenge at hand was to reconsider the student's experience submitting their time sheets.

    <p>To identify the existing problems,  research began with a series of contextual inquiries.  These one-on-one interviews highlighted a few key take-aways. First, the context wherein submitting a timesheet occurs is crucial. Participants entering their hours at home, long after their shift, put in more effort and were often inaccurate. Participants overwhelmingly cited forgetfulness as the reason they didn't enter their hours at work. Additionally, an overload of information on each page caused breakdowns in each participant's process. The system lacks appropriate feedback, so tasks are often completed without confidence. Without feedback (confirmation), many participants failed to submit their timesheets for approval. A final round of contextual inquiries involved the managers for several of the initial participants. These interviews offered insight on relevant information after the submission of the time sheets.</p>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>

  <div class="project-description">
    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>After completing the contextual inquiries, and compiling the data, a few initial solutions emerged. A punch in, punch out button offered a solution to many of the existing problems. It would simplify the process of adding time, provided much-needed feedback and increase accuracy. All ideas focused around leveraging a smarter system that could learn over time and predict a user's needs. One participant noted they entered the same times each week, as their schedule rarely changed. The solution would be to predict and offer suggestions as a user enters their time manually based on this history. The visual design and layout focused on legibility and organization. Excess input fields and information should be accessible, but not always visible.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>The final solution addressed the four major issues identified in the user research. First, the redesign combats the previous application's excess of information. Only the essential fields used by users appear on screen. Due to technical requirements, identified when interviewing supervisors, all other fields are still accessible. Second, reduced page clicks and use of "human" language eases any previous navigation issues. In the original application, feedback caused a majority of the breakdowns. Now, all status changes (saved, deleted, etc.) are obvious and clear. An intentional color palette and icon system creates consistency. Finally, two features reduce the pain of entering the same information each day or week. A punch-in, punch-out button completes the simplest tasks with a single click. Auto-populated data, based on previously entered timesheets, helps students with fixed, regular hours. This automatic data appears as a suggestion to the user, which allows for flexibility.</p>

        <p class="project-caption little-p">The original application required three new windows, and a minimum of 4 new pages to submit a single timesheet. This solution requires no new windows and only two new pages. Simplifying this sequence and reducing clicks saves users time and confusion.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>

  <div class="project-description">
    <div class="rule"></div>
    <p>Several tools, Axure (wireframes), Sketch (design) and Invision (user testing), were used to arrive at the final solution.   A few minor adjustments were the result of additional user testing. The feedback was positive. Distinct behaviors among new and frequent users melted away. Users found the new system clear and accessible. The leveraged design patterns from the rest of the "MyUW" experience was crucial to this. What was once a confusing, fallible system is now efficient and encouraging.</p>
