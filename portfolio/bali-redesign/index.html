title: Bali Blinds Redesign
description: Bali Blinds has been providing quality window coverings to do-it-yourselfers across North America for nearly eight decades. As an industry leader, Bali excels at giving each customer the inspiration and information they need to pick, measure and install beautiful custom blinds and shades. In 2017, the brand identity was optimized for use in digital contexts, an increasingly important part of Bali Blindsâ€™ business model. This ambitious refresh started with the relaunch of baliblinds.com and will soon extend to dozens of retail e-commerce microsites and other marketing channels.
